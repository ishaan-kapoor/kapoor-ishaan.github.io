If not search engine (or keyword) is defined the default search engine (gogole) will be used<br>
i.e. ```<keyword><space><search query>```<br>
e.g. ```github kapoor-ishaan```<br>
e.g. ```spotify shot me down```<br>
e.g. ```reddit programming humour```<br>

P.S.
    This webpage is very basic and unintuitive, but it will surely be improved upon post comprehensive exams (29th June)
